quassel-irssi
=============

An irssi plugin to connect to quassel core

You can discuss about it on #quassel-irssi on Freenode.

Huge thanks to QuasselDroid. QuasselDroid protocol code is way easier to read than Quassel's.

How to build
------------

First install irssi-dev (on debian-based distributions) or irssi-devel (on rpm distributions),
everything needed to compile C code, based on glib2 and git. 
You might also need SSL libs (libssl-dev on debian)
Then:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/phhusson/quassel-irssi.git
    cd quassel-irssi/core
    grep -R -l ssl_ | xargs sed -i 's/ssl_/tls_/g' {}
    grep -R -l _ssl | xargs -I '{}' sed -i 's/_ssl/_tls/g' {}
    make user_install

How to use
----------

Edit ~/.irssi/config and add a quassel chatnet with Quassel type, and your quassel server accordingly:

    chatnets = {
      quassel_phh = {
        type = "Quassel";
      };
    };

    servers = (
      { address = "quassel.phh.me"; port = "4242"; chatnet = "quassel_phh"; password="password"; use_ssl="yes"; }
    );

You may disable ssl if you really need to.

You also need to have your login equal to your nick:

    settings = {
      core = { nick = "phh"; };
    }
  
(I'm guessing it's not needed, you can specifiy it on /connect command)

Then, launch irssi, and do:

    /load quassel
    /connect quassel_phh
  
(where quassel_phh is the chatnet name)

To automtically connect to it, you can add:

    load quassel
    connect quassel_phh
  
in your ~/.irssi/startup

If someone knows how to do all this 100% from irssi text frontend, i'd appreciate it :-)

Associated scripts
------------------

- trackbar.pl:
 quassel-irssi implements trackar.pl behaviours, but linked with the core:
 the trackbar is synchronized among quassel clients.

- adv_windowlist.pl
 hidden buffers have -1 activity level.
 adv_windowlist.pl compares activity level to awl_hide_data, which by default is set to 0.
 Meaning, adv_windowlist.pl, in its default setting, will only show unhidden buffers.


Available settings
------------------

In appropriate chatnet section (in this example, quassel_phh section), you can add some settings:
- legacy is a boolean to define wether to use the legacy (< 0.10) protocol, or the newer one, which includes compression.
- load_backlog is an integer between 0, 1, 2 to load backlog on connect.
 0 means no loading, 1 means loading backlog on unhidden buffers, 2 means loading backlog on all buffers
- backlog_additional is a positive integer to specify how much backlog you want to get.
 By default, quassel-irssi gets max 150 unread messages per buffer. Setting backlog_additional to X requests X additional messages to the unread messages.


Phh's config
------------

I'm using the following scripts:
- adv_windowlist.pl
 List "open" buffers
- go.pl
 I have many opened buffers, so i do /go chan when i don't have a shortcut to a buffer.
 Because the channel names in irssi start with X-# where X is the number of network,
 i deleted the ^ line 104, to be able to just do /go quassel-irssi

- nickcolor.pl
- usercount.pl

If you're using screen, you may want to add nicklist.pl.


Dependencies
------------

You'll need basic build systems, openssl, irssi, and glib libraries and includes to build this.

For instance on a debian/ubuntu:

    apt-get install build-essential libglib2.0-dev irssi-dev libssl-dev



Additional notes
----------------

If you don't want to have your password in your config file, you can drop the password="" option and call:
/server quassel-core.example.net 0 [yourpassword]
